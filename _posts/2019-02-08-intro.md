2.教学目的、方法和内容 {#contents}
---------------------------
人类通常是通过全面的观察来了解世界，但计算机通常是经过训练来执行特定任务。软件是拓展人类认知能力和执行任务的一种计算机系统。人类认知能力分为五个层次(RUAAEC)：记忆、理解、应用、分析、评价和创造。设计和构建有价值的软件是全面动员人类多层智力的高级活动。高级软件工程是对这项智力活动的规律进行系统化总结和提炼的学科。

The goal of this course is to make you a software engineer. A software engineer does way more than just coding. They think about requirements and how the software they are building improve the society, they think about the best architectural decisions for that particular software system, they develop high-quality code that will be easy to be maintained in the future, they make sure that their software works by means of rigorous testing. Last but not least, software engineers continuously reflect and adapt their behavior, so that they deliver better software every day.

The course covers the most important software engineering practices needed to build high-quality software systems. The overall goal is to give the students the instruments to become Software Professionals. The course covers both high-level software project management, and low-level software design techniques needed to create evolvable and maintainable systems.

Specific topics covered include requirements engineering, security and performance testing, business modeling, software architecture, design patterns, user interface design, and software metrics.

In the lab work, students will apply a selection of techniques to a group project they will develop and to weekly assignments on theoretical aspects. 

3.学习目标和预期效果 {#outcomes}
---------------------------------
学习目标

(1)Students are able to recall and list all the presented software engineering methods, which are designed and used to build maintainable and evolvable software systems.
(2)Students can describe when all the presented software engineering methods are commonly used in current software development.
(3)Students can use presented software visualization techniques and software metrics to obtain an overview of an existing software system and to detect anomalies in the structure of the code.
(4)Students can judge the real benefits/drawbacks of using certain design patterns and software validation techniques in a given software project.
(5)Students can follow agile methodologies to develop a new software project.
(6)Students can derive the valid requirements for a new software project, given natural language descriptions and interaction with stakeholders.
(7)Students can create a new software project, by applying the most appropriate software engineering practices, given the context of development. 

预期效果

(1)Create your own development process based on agile methodologies
(2)Explore and write different requirements for your software in form of use cases or user stories
(3)Plan, implement, and review your software
(4)Reflect and improve your process
(5)Test your software as if there was no tomorrow
(6)Improve and refactor your code
(7)Continuously integrate and store your code in modern tools like Git and GitLab

4.授课对象 {#audience}
---------------------------
Target audience: GUCAS Computer Science,Software Engineering and other relevant fields

5.预备知识和使用语言 {#prior-knew}
----------------------------
中文、英文、HTML、CSS、JavaScript、Ruby、Python 
Students participating in the course are expected to have prior knowledge about programming and the object-oriented paradigm. The required knowledge level is the one that would allow to take and pass the programming exams of bachelor’s course. 
Students who do not have appropriate previous knowledge should not participate in the course. If they decide to participate, it is at their own risk.
